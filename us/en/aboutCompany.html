                        In July 2016, in addition to our original English brand name, iTalkBB released its new Chinese brand name "蜻蜓"（Qingting） and logo. In Chinese, the pronunciation of "Qingting" is "listen carefully", which reflects iTalkBB's respect for each of our users, our dedication in listening to every user, and our mission to provide the kinds of products and services that meet the needs of overseas Chinese.
                        <br><br>
                        Our logo is made up of two dragonflies in flight, which represents the culture of overseas immigrants and that of the countries they relocate to fitting together in harmony.
                        The two dragonflies form an interlocking circle, symbolizing iTalkBB's hope to connect the global world.
                        <br><br>
                        The new brand name and logo demonstrates iTalkBB's dedication to better serving its foreign-born customers. With the new Chinese brand name and logo, iTalkBB wants to spread its message to broader markets and new customers: life is good everywhere.
