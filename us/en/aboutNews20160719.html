                    iTalkBB, the world's leading Chinese telecommunication service provider, has announced its Chinese name and new logo, in an effort to better serve its overseas Chinese customers around the world. While retaining its English name, iTalkBB has added two Chinese characters "Qing Ting", which means dragonfly, to its brand name and logo.
                </p>

                <p class="templateText title18 mTitle26 pin">In Chinese language, dragonfly is the homonym for listening. For iTalkBB, it means that the company values every customer and is happy to listen to its customers' needs. iTalkBB strives to provide overseas Chinese with products and services they really want. Ms. Li Lei, Executive Vice President of iTalkBB explained: "The two dragonflies flying on the logo resemble the communication and integration between immigrants' traditional culture and the culture of the country they live in. The round shape formed by the dragonflies symbolizes iTalkBB's dream of global communication."</p>

                <p class="templateText title18 mTitle26 pin">Since its inception in 2003, iTalkBB has been dedicated to providing a better life for immigrants. During the past thirteen years, iTalkBB's products and services have been tailored to immigrants' needs. This has enabled iTalkBB to reach over 1.2 million users and become a household brand among overseas Chinese in North America. Yet iTalkBB aspires to grow beyond the current status to achieve the dream of "global communication".

                <p class="templateText title18 mTitle26 pin">During the past thirty years, the population of overseas Chinese has increased significantly. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Chinese population in the U.S. has increased from 4 million in 2011 to 4.52 million in 2015. New immigrants, those who were born outside the U.S., account for 60 percent of the increase. Chinese is the largest Asian group and the second largest ethnic minority group in the U.S., next to Mexicans. With the growing popularity of international study and immigration in China, the growth of Chinese population in the U.S. is expected to pick up.</p>

                <p class="templateText title18 mTitle26 pin">Meanwhile, the growing number of Chinese studying overseas has largely enhanced the overall level of education and economic status of overseas Chinese. Among Chinese in the U.S., 52 percent hold bachelor's degrees and 1/4 hold master's degrees, which is significantly higher than the 1/9 of Americans.</p>

                <p class="templateText title18 mTitle26 pin">The launch of the new name and logo is to adapt to the changing market needs. It will enable the company to stay closer to both old and new immigrant customers. The change in the name and logo won't affect the function of iTalkBB's products and services. Chinese customers can call iTalkBB's products and services in Chinese: Qing Ting Phone and Qing Ting TV. Moreover, iTalkBB will launch more diversified and customized products and services for overseas Chinese.</p>

                <p class="templateText title18 mTitle26 pin">Ms. Li Lei, Executive Vice President of iTalkBB, said: "The launch of our Chinese name and logo is a new starting point. We hope that through the brand new Chinese name and logo, more and more people will understand the idea of iTalkBB Qing Ting: Life is good everywhere. Meanwhile, we will continuously work to create a better life for overseas Chinese."</p>
