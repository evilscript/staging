                "Asian-Americans are the FASTEST-GROWING population segment. Their buying power will hit $1 TRILLION by 2018 and become one of the most important multicultural communities with great fortunes."  
                </p>
                
                <p class="templateText text16 mText24">
                	These statements were given by Victoria Lei, the Executive Vice President of iTalkBB, during an award presentation at the 2017 ANA's Multicultural Marketing & Diversity Conference in Miami, FL.

                </p>
                
                <p class="templateText text16 mText24">
                Ms. Lei emphasized that Asian-Americans are making a great impact on the advertising industry. Their buying power is greater than the economies of all but 17 countries worldwide, and their median household income is 39% higher than the national average. "It is imperative for companies to resonate with this unique community and develop successful multicultural strategies," Ms. Lei added. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="templateText text16 mText24">
                Indeed, the Asian-American community was one of the most widely discussed topics this year and was emphasized by many of the speakers. Big brands and agencies are increasing their advertising budget to appeal to this rapidly growing category in order to expand their customer base to the Asian-American community and take advantage of their buying power.

                Mr. Tettamanti, the SVP/Cross-Border Marketing of Mastercard Worldwide, the winner of the “Best in Show”, predicted that multicultural marketing will be the general marketing in the future.

                The 2017 ANA Multicultural Excellence Awards were granted to raise awareness and increase exposure of the outstanding work being done in the area of multicultural advertising, the most profound theme of this year. Claudine Waite, the Director of ANA and the conference's host, mentioned that "what we saw was an increased intensity on appropriately reaching the multicultural segment, and especially this year, we bring a great focus on the strong growth of the buying power of Asian-Americans”.

Brands like Xoom, State Farm, and the U.S. Marine Corps are creating innovative marketing campaigns and spending great effort to break into this expansive market. This year, the final winner of the Asian-American category was Xoom, "XoomLOL Comedy Series”, Keyframe, Inc.
