												<p>YOUR AGREEMENT WITH ITALK STARTS WHEN YOU ACCEPT. You represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years old and you are legally authorized to enter into this Agreement. You accept your Agreement by doing any of the following: (a) giving us a written or electronic signature, or telling us orally that you accept; (b) activating Service; (c) using your Service after you make a change or addition; (d) paying for the Service or an “iTalk Mobile Device” (a Device purchased from iTalk Mobile, an iTalk Mobile dealer, or other iTalk Mobile authorized retailer (“Dealer”)); (e) opening the iTalk Mobile SIM card package or (f) opening the iTalk Mobile SIM card package or failing to activate Service within thirty (30) days after the purchase of your iTalk Mobile Service including the SIM card.

	       								<p class="titleMgnBtm title22 mTitle30 fwb"><a name="terms2no"></a>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. </p>
		   								<div class="text16 mText24">
		   	  								<p>ITALK MOBILE AND YOU EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR SERVICE, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. This includes any claims against other parties relating to Service or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. iTalk Mobile and you each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision in Section 24). THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES).</p>

		   	  								<p>Notwithstanding the above, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTIVATED A NEW LINE OF SERVICE (the “Opt Out Deadline”). You must opt out by the Opt Out Deadline for each line of Service. You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-855-482-5566. Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.</p>
		   	 								<p>For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address set forth in Section 14 below. iTalk Mobile and you each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If iTalk Mobile and you are unable to resolve the claim within sixty (60) days after iTalk Mobile receives your claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. iTalk Mobile and you each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, iTalk Mobile may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the Agreement.</p>
		   	  								<p>If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see Section 14) to begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will arbitrate all disputes. For claims of less than Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, iTalk Mobile and you will share equally all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00). For claims that total more than Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys’ fees.</p>
		   	  								<p>CLASS ACTION WAIVER. ITALK MOBILE AND YOU EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding against iTalk Mobile.</p>
		   	  								<p>JURY TRIAL WAIVER. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, ITALK MOBILE AND YOU EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</p>

We or our network supplier may use a variety of information and methods to determine the location of a 9-1-1 call, including Global Positioning Satellites, our network supplier’s wireless network, the street address you have provided us as your primary use location (“Primary Address”), or other information. Even with this information, an emergency operator may not be able to locate you in order to provide emergency services. Other third party entities are involved in connecting a 9-1-1 call and neither iTalk Mobile nor its network supplier determines the public safety agency to which your 9-1-1 call is routed. If you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is being implemented.

For disputed Charges, see Section 13. You agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing information and to report all changes within thirty (30) days of the change. We round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute. Airtime usage is measured from the time the network begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up). You may be charged for more than one call/message when you use certain features resulting in multiple inbound or outbound calls/messages (such as call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail, conference calling, and multi-party messaging). Most usage and Charges incurred during a billing cycle will be included in your bill for that cycle. Some usage and Charges may be delayed to a later billing cycle, which may cause you to exceed service plan allotments in a later billing cycle. Unused service plan allotments expire at the end of your billing cycle unless otherwise stated in your service plan. Airtime usage applies to all calls processed through your Device, including toll-free, operator-assisted, voice mail, call forwarding and calling card calls. You may be billed additional Charges or fees for certain features and services such as operator or directory assistance, data calls or transfers, messaging, Internet access and applications.</span></p>

		   	  									<p class="clearfix"><span class="Sharp">&gt;</span><span class="textCon">Data Usage and Messaging. Data usage is rounded up to the next full-kilobyte increment at the end of each data session. At the end of your billing cycle, or at the time you switch data plans, your total kilobytes are then rounded up to the next megabyte. There are 1,024 kilobytes in one megabyte, and 1,024 megabytes in one gigabyte. You will be charged for text, instant or picture messages and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited. We use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages, and we are not liable for such messages.</span></p>

		   	  									<p class="clearfix"><span class="Sharp">&gt;</span><span class="textCon">Data Usage Level. iTalk Mobile has set a high-speed data usage level (“Usage Level”) for each of its customers. Such Usage Level varies based on the service plan you have selected., we measure your upload and download data usage (“Actual Usage”) to determine if your total Actual Usage, as aggregated over your service period (“Usage Total”), exceeds the Usage Level for the service plan you selected. Please note that “Actual Usage” includes all of your requests to upload or download data, whether or not such data is actually uploaded or downloaded. For example, if you request that an image to be downloaded to your Device, but travel outside of your network coverage area before the download is complete; such request will be included in your Actual Usage even though the image was never downloaded to your Device. If you exceed your service plan Usage Level, iTalk Mobile and its underlying providers will reduce the speed at which you can send and receive data over the iTalk Mobile network until the end of the applicable service period. Once you begin a new service period, your service plan Usage Level will be reset and your upload and download speeds will be restored. For example, if a customer purchases a service plan that includes unlimited data service, but only includes up to 1 gigabyte of high speed data service during a given month, then the first gigabyte of data requested by that customer in that month will provided at up to 4G speeds (subject to 4G network availability). Any data uploaded or downloaded by that customer in excess of 1 gigabyte will be provided at speeds of 128 kbps or less. Please be aware that your Usage Level is much more likely to exceed your service plan Usage Level if you use peer-to-peer file sharing programs, a webcam, or if you download significant quantities of music files, movies, software applications, or engage in other high-bandwidth activities.</span></p>

		   	  									<p class="clearfix"><span class="Sharp">&gt;</span><span class="textCon">Protective Measures. To provide a good experience for the majority of our customers and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we may take measures including temporarily reducing data throughput for a subset of customers who use a disproportionate amount of bandwidth. If you use your Data Plan in a manner that could interfere with other customers’ service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data session, or switch you to a more appropriate Data Plan. We also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services. Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as caching less data, using less capacity and sizing video more appropriately for a Device to transmit data files more efficiently. These practices are agnostic to the content itself and to the websites that provide it. While we avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process when practical, the process may impact the appearance of files as displayed on your Device.</span></p>

		   								<div class="text16 mText24">
		   	  								<p>ITALK AND YOU EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR SERVICE, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. This includes any claims against other parties relating to Service or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, Dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. iTalk and you each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply (despite the choice of law provision). THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES).</p>

		   	  								<p>Notwithstanding the above, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTIVATED A NEW LINE OF SERVICE (the "Opt Out Deadline"). You must opt out by the Opt Out Deadline for each line of Service. You may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-877-482-5503. Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.</p>
		   	 								<p>For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address set forth in Section 19 below. iTalk and you each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If iTalk and you are unable to resolve the claim within sixty (60) days after iTalk receives your claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration. iTalk and you each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, iTalk may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or cost of collection permitted by law or the T&C.</p>

		   	  								<p>If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent to begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") will arbitrate all disputes. For claims of less than Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, iTalk and you will share equally all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00). For claims that total more than Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00), the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys' fees.</p>

		   	  								<p>CLASS ACTION WAIVER. ITALK AND YOU EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding against iTalk.</p>

You agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing information and to report all changes within thirty (30) days of the change. We round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute. Airtime usage is measured from the time the network begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up). You may be charged for more than one call/message when you use certain features resulting in multiple inbound or outbound calls/messages (such as voicemail, conference calling, and multi-party messaging). Most usage and Charges incurred during a billing cycle will be included in your bill for that cycle. Some usage and Charges may be delayed to a later billing cycle, which may cause you to exceed service plan allotments in a later billing cycle. Unused service plan allotments including data, calling minutes and messages expire at the end of your billing cycle. Airtime usage applies to all calls processed through your Device, including toll-free, operator-assisted, voice mail, call forwarding and calling card calls. You may be billed additional Charges or fees for certain features and services such as operator or directory assistance, data calls or transfers, messaging, Internet access and applications. b.	Data Usage and Messaging. Data usage is rounded up to the next full-kilobyte increment at the end of each data session. At the end of your billing cycle, or at the time you switch data plans, your total kilobytes are then rounded up to the next megabyte. There are 1,024 kilobytes in one megabyte, and 1,024 megabytes in one gigabyte. You will be charged for text, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited.

Please note that "Actual Usage" includes all of your requests to upload or download data, whether or not such data is actually uploaded or downloaded.

To provide a good experience for the majority of our customers and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, iTalk and its underlying providers take measures including temporarily reducing data throughput for a subset of customers who use a disproportionate amount of bandwidth. If you use your data plan in a manner that could interfere with other customers' service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data session, or switch you to a more appropriate Data Plan per the request of our service provider. We also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services. Additionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as caching less data, using less capacity, and sizing video more appropriately for a Device to transmit data files more efficiently. These practices are agnostic to the content itself and to the websites that provide it. While we avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process when practical, the process may impact the appearance of files as displayed on your Device.</span></p>

		   								<div class="text16 mText24">
		   	  								<p>The safety and security of customers is of the utmost importance to iTalkBB. iTalkBB is happy to announce that it now offers 911 Emergency Dialing Services to its customers. However, iTalkBB's Emergency Dialing Services are VoIP based services, and therefore, are subject to certain limitations and outage factors that are different from traditional 911 accesses. It is important that you read, understand and inform all residents and guests of these important limitations.</p>
		   	  								<p>CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SERVICES DO NOT SUPPORT TRADITIONAL 911 ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES. WHERE AVAILABLE, ITALKBB SERVICES DO INCLUDE E911 ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES, AND IN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHERE E911 IS NOT AVAILABLE, ITALKBB SERVICES INCLUDE EMERGENCY DIALING. WHERE E911 IS AVAILABLE, A 911 CALL IS ROUTED DIRECTLY TO 911 DISPATCHERS. WHERE E911 IS NOT AVAILABLE, 911 CALLS ARE ROUTED TO GENERAL EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND THE CALLER MAY BE REQUIRED TO VERBALLY STATE HIS OR HER ADDRESS. THE CALL IS THEN ROUTED TO THE APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY SERVICE DISPATCHER. ITALKBB ADVISES CUSTOMER TO MAINTAIN OR ACQUIRE AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF ACCESSING 911 SERVICES. YOU AGREE TO ADVISE ALL HOUSEHOLD RESIDENTS, GUESTS AND OTHER PERSONS WHO MAY BE PRESENT AT THE PHYSICAL LOCATION WHERE YOU UTILIZE THE SERVICE OF EACH OF THE LIMITATION OF THE ITALKBB EMERGENCY DIALING SERVICE AND OF AN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF 911 DIALING.</p>	
		   	  								<p class="org">IMPORTANT EMERGENCY DIALING LIMITATIONS</p>
		   	  								<p> Customer understands and acknowledges that the iTalkBB emergency dialing feature cannot be used in conjunction with an iTalkBB "Virtual Telephone Number". An iTalkBB Virtual Telephone Number is assigned to each customer. The number always includes an area code of 899. These Virtual Telephone Numbers are NOT loaded into national emergency databases and will not function to access emergency services. All customers must purchase a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) traditional telephone number from iTalkBB in order to access iTalkBB Emergency Services. Customer further acknowledges that iTalkBB Services do not function with outdialing services including home security systems, medical monitoring equipment, fax machines or satellite television systems.</p>
		   	  								<p class="org">REGISTRATION OF PHYSICAL LOCATION REQUIRED</p>
		   	  								<p>For each PSTN phone number that you use for the Services, you must provide the physical location where you will be using the Service. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE A PHYSICAL ADDRESS TO ITALKBB, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UTILIZE 911 SERVICES AND YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY CLAIM OF LIABILTIY AGAINST ITALKBB. When you move the Equipment (Equipment refers to the iTalkBB Adapter sent to you by iTalkBB), you must register your new physical location with iTalkBB. All 911 calls are directed to emergency responders based upon the address you register with iTalkBB. If you move the Equipment and do not register the new physical location, emergency responders will be dispatched to your previous physical address.</p>
		   	  								<p class="org">SERVICE OUTAGES; BROADBAND OUTAGES; CONGESTION; AND SERVICE INTERRUPTION</p>
		   	  								<p>iTalkBB emergency dialing services will not function in the event of a power outage or other interruption to your electricity service until the power supply is fully restored. Following a power disruption, you may need to reset your Equipment before the iTalkBB Service, including the emergency dialing service will function properly. Service outages or suspensions or terminations of service by your broadband provider or ISP will prevent the Service, including the iTalkBB emergency dialing service from functioning. Any interruption in your internet access will prevent you from placing 911 calls during the interruption. Broadband phone service is inherently subject to more network congestion and reduced speed in the routing of 911 calls than traditional 911 dialing over traditional public telephone networks. In the event that your iTalkBB account is suspended or terminated for any reason, your iTalkBB Service, including iTalkBB emergency dialing service will not function.</p>
		   	  								<p class="org">DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</p>
		   	  								<p>iTalkBB does not control how 911 calls are answered or handled by any local emergency response center. iTalkBB disclaims all responsibility for the actions and conduct of any and all national and local emergency response centers. iTalkBB relies entirely upon third parties to route 911 calls to local and national emergency response centers. iTalkBB disclaims any and all liability or responsibility in the event such third party data used to route the call is incorrect or produces an erroneous result. Neither iTalkBB nor its office , directors or employees may be held liable for any claim, damage or loss and you hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action arising from or related to the Services unless such claims arose from iTalkBB's gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct. You, on your own behalf and on behalf of any third party, hereby agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless iTalkBB, its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) relating to the absence, failure or outage of the Service, including the iTalkBB emergency dialing service or access to emergency service personnel.</p>
		   	  								<p class="org">CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF SERVICE</p>
		   	  								<p>If you cancel your iTalkBB Service or, if iTalkBB terminates your iTalkBB Service for any reason, you will no longer have access to 911 Emergency Dialing Services.</p>
		   	  								<p class="org">UNDERSTANDING, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ALTERNATIVE 911 SERVICE:</p>
		   	  								<p>You hereby acknowledge your understanding of the limitations of the iTalkBB emergency dialing services described above. In the event that you are not completely comfortable with the limitations of the Service, including the iTalkBB emergency dialing service, you should immediately take action to acquire an alternative means to access 911 services or you should immediately terminate the Services.</p>

		   	  								<p>You acknowledge that iTalkBB Service may not be compatible with all non-voice communications equipment, including without limitation, home security systems, TTY, medical monitoring equipment, certain versions of TIVo, satellite television systems, PBX, Centrex, other private telephone networks, or computer modems. You waive any claim against iTalkBB for interference with or disruption of these services and equipment, as well as any claim that iTalkBB is responsible for any disruption of your business, if applicable.</p>
		   	  								<p>While iTalkBB Service may work with a home alarm system, iTalkBB does not recommend it. If for any reason you lose broadband connectivity due to a power outage or problem with your Internet provider, iTalkBB Services will not work and your alarm system will not be able to make an emergency call. For this reason, iTalkBB recommends you keep a basic landline dedicated to your home alarm system and use iTalkBB Services for your other calling needs.</p>

										<p>Monthly usage which is 30% higher than the average usage by iTalk residential customers is considered unusual and excessive usage and is subject to evaluation by iTalk. In addition, usage involving specific numbers called, average call durations, forwarding and transferring, conferencing and unusually short duration calling may, constitute impermissible use(s) of iTalk Plan services.</p>

										<p>Based on these factors, iTalk may determine that abnormal, unreasonable or impermissible usage is occurring, and may take appropriate steps including but not limited to suspend or terminate your service to enforce this Reasonable Residential Use Policy.</p>

										<p>iTalkBB reserves the right to review and evaluate all customer accounts and to take action if an account is outside of its Reasonable Residential Use Policy or involves impermissible, detrimental or unlawful use. iTalkBB may assess abnormal usage based on comparisons to the usage patterns and levels of our other customers. If any customer's use is determined by iTalk, in its sole discretion, to be outside of its Reasonable Residential Use Policy, iTalkBB reserves the right to transfer the customer's account to an appropriate business Plan, charge more appropriate rates for actual usage or to suspend or terminate service with or without notice. If any customer's use is determined to be unlawful, iTalkBB will immediately suspend or terminate the service with or without notice. iTalkBB will notify all proper authorities of any illegal use of iTalk's service and will cooperate with all such authorities regarding investigation and prosecution. iTalkBB hereby reserves all of its legal rights.</p>

	       							<p class="titleMgnBtm title22 mTitle30 fwb"><a name="terms7phone"></a>Billing, Charges and Payment</p>
		   							<div class="text16 mText24">
		   								<p class="fwb">Credit Card Payment</p>
										<p>Upon purchase, Customer must provide iTalkBB a valid credit card number from an accepted issuer (see iTalk's website for accepted issuers). Customer authorizes iTalkBB to charge the credit card number ("Credit Card") for all charges arising from Customer's use of the Services. Customer shall notify iTalkBB of any change to the Credit Card information including, without limitation, changes in account number, expiration date and billing address.</p>

										<p class="fwb">Invoicing</p>
										<p>iTalkBB will provide Customer with a monthly on-line invoice for Services and bill all charges invoiced to Customer's account to the Credit Card. Charges shall include, Equipment purchases, monthly service fees, usage fees, shipping charges, Early Termination Fees, toll charges, taxes and all other applicable charges. Monthly service fees are paid in advance of each month's Service. Toll charges and other applicable charges are billed at the end of each service month. Deposits, if applicable, are charged at the time of purchase and are invoiced whenever the deposit is reduced by usage to $6.00 dollars. iTalkBB reserves the right to charge Customer's Credit Card at any time during a service month if Customer's toll charges exceed $24.00 dollars. Billing for monthly service fees, deposits and other applicable charges commences upon purchase of Services, and the first month's monthly service fees will be prorated to take into account any partial month of Service. Activation occurs when Customer's Equipment is registered to iTalk's systems ("Activation").</p>

										<p class="fwb">Toll Charges.</p>
										<p>All calls to or from Equipment using the Services that originates or terminates in the Public Switched Telephone Network ("PSTN") is subject to the then applicable toll charges that are associated with the service plan Customer has selected. All calls to destinations outside the United States to a party that is not an iTalkBB Customer will be charged at the then current international rates published on iTalk's website. The duration of each call will be calculated in one minute increments.</p>

										<p class="fwb">Telephone Numbers.</p>
										<p>Any telephone number provided to Customer by iTalkBB shall be leased and not sold. Customer may not use such number with any other devise other than the Equipment with the express prior written consent of iTalk. iTalkBB reserves the right to change, cancel or move the number in its sole discretion. The availability of all China DID numbers is subject to and dependent upon the network facilities and regulatory environment in China. iTalkBB cannot guarantee connection to any China DID from all cities and regions in China. iTalkBB further cannot guarantee uninterrupted service on China DIDs.</p>

										<p class="fwb">Billing Disputes</p>
										<p>Customer must dispute any charges for the Services within thirty (30) days of receipt of the monthly on-line invoice. Customer understands and agrees that Customer's failure to dispute any charges with the thirty (30) day time period constitutes a waiver of all claims to any dispute.</p>

										<p class="fwb">Late Payment - Non-Payment.</p>
										<p>If any charges for Services are due but unpaid for any reason including, without limitation, non-payment or declined Credit Card charges, iTalkBB may suspend or terminate the Services and all accrued charges shall immediately be due and payable, to include a late fee of the lesser of 1.5% or the maximum allowed by law. If charges cannot be processed to the Credit Card, Customer will be charged a fee of ten dollars ($10.00). Neither suspension nor termination shall relieve Customer from the obligation to pay all amounts owing under this Agreement.</p>

										<p class="fwb">Automatic Renewal of Global Annual Plans.</p>
										<p>On or about the Anniversary Date of any Global Annual Plan the plan will be automatically renewed for an additional one year term by charging Customers credit card of record, unless not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Anniversary Date, Customer provides iTalkBB notice of Customer's desire to cancel service or change to a different calling plan or payment plan.</p>

										<p class="fwb">Applicable Regulatory Fees, Taxes, Surcharges, System Access Charges, Customer Equipment Maintenance/ Management Charges, and Intellectual Property/Legal Compliance Fees.</p>
										<p>Federal, state, provincial, county, municipal and local governments may assess regulatory fees, contribution fees, emergency dialing charges, taxes, surcharges and other compliance fees on your iTalkBB Home Phone Service. Independent third party providers may charge regulatory and administrative fees, legal/intellectual property compliance charges, equipment maintenance and management fees, surcharges, taxes and access fees for services that iTalkBB is required to pay in order to enable your access to global public telecommunications networks. iTalkBB may assess network access fees in applicable markets. These charges may be assessed to you as a flat monthly fee, a percentage of your iTalkBB Home Phone monthly service charges or both, and may change from time to time without notice. You are responsible for all such fees and charges, now in force or enacted in the future, that arise from your subscription for iTalkBB Home Phone Service. Such charges are in addition to your iTalkBB Home Phone Service charges and will be charged to your account according to the plan or payment method you have selected. Applicable portions of such fees and charges are paid to governmental agencies, third parties or retained by iTalkBB to offset applicable costs associated with your subscription for iTalkBB Home Phone Service. No such fees or charges shall be included in any refund under this Agreement. No portion of fees paid by iTalkBB to the US Federal Universal Service Fund is included in any amounts charged to customers as described in this paragraph.</p>

										<p class="fwb">CrCredits.</p>
										<p>Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Services are provided "as is, where is". No credit allowances shall be made for interruption of Service.</p>

										<p class="fwb">Promotions.</p>
										<p>iTalkBB may, in its sole discretion, from time to time offer promotions or discounts on fees. Customer must enter any promotion or discount codes upon initial purchase of the Services.</p>
